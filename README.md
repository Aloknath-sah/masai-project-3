# COVID 19
### Description
In this project I am making API call to get data from COVID-19 API and display the data in the page. I have also provide input tag for user to enter the country
and he/she can get the total number of cases in the particular country.

## Home Page
This is the landing page where user can see the total covid cases country wise.
